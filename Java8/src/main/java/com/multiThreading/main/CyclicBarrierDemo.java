//and when all threads have completed the execution,
//the result needs to be combined in the parent thread.
//In other words, a CyclicBarrier is used when multiple thread carry
//out different sub tasks and the output of these sub tasks need to be combined
//to form the final output. After completing its execution, threads call await() method
//and wait for other threads to reach the barrier. Once all the threads have reached, the barriers
//then give the way for threads to proceed
